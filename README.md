Heart disease is a life-threatening condition that can strike anyone anywhere in the world. If it can be predicted, then actions can be taken to avoid it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the largest cause of death worldwide, killing an estimated 17.9 million of people each year. In healthcare, a predictive model learns from a patient's past data in order to forecast their future illnesses and prescribe treatment. A deep learning model can help health professionals make quick judgments about medications and hospitalizations, saving time and improving the healthcare business.
The Heart Disease (HD) dataset is downloaded from Kaggle website. It was a cardiovascular cohort study of residents from the city of Framingham, Massachusetts and it has a higher number of instances (4238) compared to other HD datasets such as Cleveland, Hungarian and Long Beach Heart datasets which have 303, 294, and 200 samples respectively.
An Autoencoder- Artificial Neural Network (AE-ANN) model is implemented. Initially, the feature selection algorithms is applied and the reduced feature set will be given as an input to the autoencoder model. The low-dimensional features learned by autoencoder model fed as an input to the ANN and accuracy is evaluated.
